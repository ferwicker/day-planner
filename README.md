## Motivation
Our work days move FAST, and it is often hard to keep track of the day as a big picture. Paper journals are easy to jot on, and online calendars such as Google Calendar help us keep track of events with our coworkers, but neither of these options offers a super simplified view of our day and to do's that we can easily edit for our own use. This planner aims to provide a solution for this. With easily editable time blocks for notes and events, it offers the best of paper and online planners.

## Process
As always, the design process starts on paper, then transferred to Adobe XD for layour and styles to help simplify the HTML and CSS developing step. This project uses dynamically updated HTML and CSS elements throughout.

## Built with
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/xd.html) (prototyping)

## Features
### Design and layout
The design and layout of this application are created with usablity and ease on the eyes for long term and seamless use within your day. The colours are calm and pleasing, the layout presents your day as a whole, with a separate section for to do's that don't fit in any one hour of the day, so they are not forgotten.
### To-do list
Not everything we do during the day has a set time slot, and addind general to do's to a certain time might contribute to them being overlooked and forgotten. A separate To Do list section helps you keep track of this items and check them off as you go.
### Auto Save
Although previous versions of this project used individual 'Save' buttons for each hour block to save events, I found during testing that this method was not very user friendly for daily use. The latest version uses a set interval to auto save notes, removing the need for save buttons.

### Real time updates
The clock and the colours of the time blocks update in real time to reflect the present, past and future events.
### Expanding time blocks
Room for all your notes! The time blocks expand as you write to accommodate all your notes and events with no need of scrolling on each hour slot.
### Daily quotes
A random quote displays in the header of the application, quotes are chosen randomly and range from fun and lighearted to inspirational and famous quotes.
